; used as input for AIProcessEnergyCards to determine what to check
; and whether to play card after the routine is over.
; I suspect AI_ENERGY_FLAG_DONT_PLAY to be a flag to signal the routine
; not to actually play the energy card after it's finished,
; but AIProcessEnergyCards checks whether ANY flag is set in order
; to decide not to play it, so it's redundant in the presence of another flag.

; used to determine which Trainer cards for AI
; to process in AIProcessHandTrainerCards.
; these go in chronological order, except for
; AI_TRAINER_CARD_PHASE_14 which happens just before AI attacks.
; AI_TRAINER_CARD_PHASE_15 is reserved for Professor Oak card.
; if Professor Oak is played, all other Trainer card phases
; are processed again except AI_TRAINER_CARD_PHASE_15.
